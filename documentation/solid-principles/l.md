# Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

"Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclass without affecting the correctness of the program."

Inheritance hierarchies are well designed and subclasses adhere to contracts defined by their superclasses. Violating LSP can lead to unexpected behavior and errors when substituting objects.
