# Encapsulation
This involves bundling the data, or attributes, or fields, or methods, into a single unit called a class.

Encapsulation helps hiding internal implementation details of a class by only exposing the necessary functionalities.

Refer to ConsoleApp/src/OopPrincples/Encapsulation for examples of bad practices and using encapsulation to fix those bad practices.
