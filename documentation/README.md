## Introduction
This course aims to teach the SOLID principles and the 23 design patterns from the Gang of Four.

These design patterns can be grouped into three categories:
- Creational: the different ways to create objects
  1) Abstract factory
  2) Builder
  3) Factory method
  4) Prototype
  5) Singleton
- Structural: the relationships between those objects
  1) Adapter
  2) Bridge
  3) Composite
  4) Decorator
  5) Facade
  6) Flyweight
  7) Proxy
- Behavioural: the interaction or communication between those objects
  1) Chain of Responsibility
  2) Command
  3) Interpreter
  4) Iterator
  5) Mediator
  6) Memento
  7) Observer
  8) State
  9) Strategy
  10) Template Method
  11) Visitor

## Design Patterns
### Why should you learn them?
1) They provide reusable solutions to common problems
2) They establish a common language for developers to communicate effectively about software design
3) They promote scalable designs by providing flexible solutions
4) Often result in more maintainable code
5) Some can help improve performance
6) They serve as a form of documentation
7) They embody best practices
8) Many are language-agnostic
