# Inheritance
This involves creating new classes (subclasses/derived classes) based on existing classes (superclasses or base classes). Subclasses inherit properties and behaviors and can also add new features or override existing ones. Inheritance is an `is-a` relationship.

Refer to ConsoleApp/src/OopPrincples/Inheritance for example of a Car or Bike inheriting from a Vehicle base class.
